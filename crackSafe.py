"""
There is a box protected by a password. The password is a sequence of n digits where each digit can be one of the first k digits 0, 1, ..., k-1.

While entering a password, the last n digits entered will automatically be matched against the correct password.

For example, assuming the correct password is "345", if you type "012345", the box will open because the correct password matches the suffix of the entered password.

Return any password of minimum length that is guaranteed to open the box at some point of entering it.

Input: n = 2, k = 2
Output: "00110"
Note: "01100", "10011", "11001" will be accepted too.

It's easy to take this problem as a graph theory, Let's take any number with n-1 digits as a vertex, to form a single and 
unique trial of the password, we extend a edge from this node, forming a n digits number. It also leads to the new node that
was indicated by it's [1:n] digits. So this problem is turned in to a graph problem defined as below:

Given a directed graph with knâˆ’1
nodes, each nodes has k edges, pointed to another node. Find a path that visits every edges exactly once.
